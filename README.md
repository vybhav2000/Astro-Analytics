# Astro-Analytics
This machine learning hackathon wqas conducted as part of Techsoc 2020, Shaastra. The competition link is given here [Astro-Analytics Hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/c/astro-analytics-techsoc-iitm/overview).The competition details are given below.
><h3>Astro Analytics Challenge</h3>
>Objective - Build a model that would predict the position of space objects using simulation data.<br>
><h3>Background information.</h3>
>
>Predicting the position of satellites is one of the most important tasks in astronomy. For example, information on the exact position of satellites in orbit is necessary to avoid >extremely dangerous satellite collisions. Each collision leads not only to satellite destruction but also results in thousands of space debris pieces. For instance, the IridIridium-
>Coscos collision in 2009 increased the number of space debris by approximately 13%.
>Further collisions may result in Kessler syndrome and the inaccessibility of outer space. Also, a more accurate prediction of satellite position will help calculate more eﬃcient >maneuvers to save propellant and extend satellite life in orbit.
><h3>What do you exactly predict?</h3>
>
>Participants are asked to clarify the prediction of a Simpliﬁed General Perturbations-4 (SGP4) model. SGP4 is able to predict a lot of eﬀects but is applied to near-Earth objects with >an orbital period of fewer than 225 minutes, while high orbit space objects have orbital periods up to 200 hours. For the true position of the satellites, the position obtained using a >more accurate simulator will be taken. Subsequently, the obtained models will be applied to real classiﬁed data and will help to predict the positions of these space objects.
